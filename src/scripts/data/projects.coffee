The Property Guide pamphlet design outlines the homes and what each has to offer. Important property guidelines and numbers are also listed for quick reference in case you have any concerns or emergencies during your stay. The Neighborhood Guide briefly outlines and maps out the different neighborhoods where the homes are located. Both of these are provided in each room for guests.'

Its faculty and alumni include some the most renowned artists, designers, and scholars in their fields.'
    process: 'The reskin of Pratt\'s current site strongly considered the need for a more friendly touch, as opposed to the useful, but bland look that showed little personality. The website is intended to be a gateway of information about campus events and news for current students, prospective students (possibly from out of state), and their parents. The redesign aimed to create a warmer atmosphere that still conveyed a wealth of useful information, while creatively demonstrating what sets Pratt apart from all the rest.'
