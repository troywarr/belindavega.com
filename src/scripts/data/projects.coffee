    process: 'The reskin of Pratt\'s current site strongly considered the need for a more friendly touch, as opposed to the useful, but bland look that showed little personality. The website is intended to be a gateway of information about campus events and news for current students, prospective students (possibly from out of state), and their parents. The redesign aimed to create a warmer atmosphere that still conveyed a wealth of useful information, while creatively demonstrating what sets Pratt apart from all the rest.'
